## Introduction
### What is software development?
#### Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process.Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.

### What is a vulnerability?
#### A vulnerability in computer security is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance. Vulnerabilities are the intersection of three elements: a system flaw, attacker access to the flaw, and attacker capability to exploit the flaw. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerability is also known as the attack surface.

## Case studies 
### Yahoo Breach 2013-2014
#### In September 2016, the once dominant Internet giant, while in negotiations to sell itself to Verizon, announced it had been the victim of the biggest data breach in history, likely by “a state-sponsored actor,” in 2014. The attack compromised the real names, email addresses, dates of birth and telephone numbers of 500 million users. The company said the "vast majority" of the passwords involved had been hashed using the robust bcrypt algorithm.

#### A couple of months later, in December, it buried that earlier record with the disclosure that a breach in 2013, by a different group of hackers had compromised 1 billion accounts. Besides names, dates of birth, email addresses and passwords that were not as well protected as those involved in 2014, security questions and answers were also compromised. In October of 2017, Yahoo revised that estimate, saying that, in fact, all 3 billion user accounts had been compromised.

#### The breaches knocked an estimated $350 million off Yahoo’s sale price. Verizon eventually paid $4.48 billion for Yahoo’s core Internet business. The agreement called for the two companies to share regulatory and legal liabilities from the breaches.

#### This has only become recently released to the public about the theft of user account details such as email addresses, telephone numbers and hashed passwords. An independant committee was set-up to investigate the incident and found that the Yahoo security team and senior executives actually knew that a state-sponsored actor had hacked certain user accounts back in 2014. The Yahoo security team also knew that the state-sponsored actor had stolen copies of backup files that had contained users' personal data. 

#### It was only about two years later when Yahoo publicly disclosed the breach. That came after a stolen database from the company allegedly went up for sale on the black market. That breach originally occurred in August 2013 but wasn’t noticed until law enforcement provided Yahoo with a copy of the stolen data last November. Because of the breaches, Yahoo said the company is facing about 43 class action lawsuits.

### Uber Breach (October 2016)
#### Uber concealed a hack that affected 57 million customers and drivers worldwide and 2.7 million users in the UK, the company has confirmed. The breach (which took place in 2016) was kept under wraps by the taxi-hailing firm, which paid hackers $100,000 (£75,000) to delete the data. Uber confirmed that names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers of customers were exposed and of the 57 million impacted, 600,000 drivers had their names and licence details compromised. 

#### And while the drivers have been offered free credit monitoring protection, the firm is yet to offer anything to affected customers. According to Bloomberg, Uber's former chief executive Travis Kalanick knew about the breach over a year ago. The firm's chief security officer Joe Sullivan has left the company. In a written statement, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said: "While we have not seen evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident, we are monitoring the affected accounts and have flagged them for additional fraud protection." Uber confirmed to the Information Commissioner that 2.7 million, over half of Uber's UK users had been affected. The National Cyber Security Centre suggested "vigilance" against email phishing or scam phone calls in light of the hack. 

####  The company said more sensitive information, such as location data, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, and birth dates, had not been compromised. Uber said in a statement to drivers that it would offer those affected free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. According to Bloomberg, the breach occured when two hackers obtained login credentials to access data stored on Uber’s Amazon Web Services account. Paul Lipman, CEO of cybersecurity firm BullGuard, said that the fact that the data was being stored unencrypted was “unforgivable”.
